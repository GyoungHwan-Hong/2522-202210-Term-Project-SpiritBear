# Explore the Lower Mainland with Spirit Bear!

This project was created in collaboration between GyungHwan-Hong and David Lee. We are currently Term 2 students in BCIT's Computer systems and technology program.

## Inspiration

We were inspired to create a quiz based game to help newcomers to Canada and Vancouver! We noticed there are some words that we use in Canada that are country specific. An example of this is a double double, which refers to 2 cream and 2 sugar in either your tea or coffee. Therefore, we created Adventures with Spirit Bear! A game with quizzes aimed at helping newcomes gain these haphazard facts.

The story of the game starts like this. There is an evil bear that has decided to conquer Vancouver and all of its tourist destinations! You, the player, play as Spirit Bear. You are tasked with completing the quizzes on each stage, so that your bear can reach a state and defeat the invading bear.
